Contains 62 samples collected from colon-cancer patients. Among them, 40 tumor biopsies are from tumors (labelled as "negative") and 22 normal (labelled as "positive") biopsies are from healthy parts of the colons of the same patients. Two thousand out of around 6500 genes were selected based on the confidence in the measured expression levels.
